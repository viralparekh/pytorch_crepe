# Pytorch_crepe

This is an re-implementation of the Crepe character-level convolutional neural net model described in paper ["Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification"] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626) with pytorch library.


I have used [py_crepe](https://github.com/johnb30/py_crepe) as a reference.
